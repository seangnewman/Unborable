# Unborable 
## An Eventful API Clone

### Overview
Our project team addressed the challenge of planning family events.  For example, the weekend is approaching and the parents are faced with how to spend time together with their children and finding appropriate events.  Many times a family may fall into familiar routines and events, leading to a lack of enthusiasm over time. Bordom begins to take place.  

Unborable steps in...

Using the Eventful API, unborable searches for events occurring within an area specified by the user.  The application then presents the events listed by date and time. If the user selects one of the events, a Google Map is presented providing directions on how to arrive at the event.
